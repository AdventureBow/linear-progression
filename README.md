# The Issue
Minecraft has a big issue for many players. Made to get to iron in five minutes, diamond in fifteen, and beat the Ender Dragon in less than an hour!
# The Solution
With Linear Progression, the real game starts when you start your world. Stone, iron, and diamond tools and equipment are far more engaging to acquire. Getting to the Nether now punishes you for not gearing up adequately. And the key to the End, the Eye of Ender, has an adventuring requirement. This forces you to explore and fight for the materials to beat the game!
